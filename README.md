# C# Regression calculator
This project takes inputs for the basic straight line regression formula, validates these inputs, does the calculations, outputs your graph shape and gives you a textual summary of the formula.
## Why?
I built this while learning C# as a opporotunity to learn more about using the windows forms features and getting the basics down for C#, it was a good learning opporotunity and being able to replicate it means that
you understand the basics of:
- If statements,
- Controlling graphical interfaces programatically
- Basic mathematical calculations

## How to use
Enter the values for each prompted field and click the designated buttons, that's it!

# Outputs:
If all values were entered correctly (a negative line chart will show up if it's a negative regression, these just show the shapes)

If one or more values weren't filled in/were filled in incorrectly the associated radio group would turn into a red color and the user would get a message:
